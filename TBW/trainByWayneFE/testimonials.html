They always seem to be able to run for miles without breaking a sweat or show any indication of being out of breath. Wayne introduced me to running in a way that was without judgment and empowering.  He taught me to gently build on what I was able to accomplish.  I started out barely able to run 7 minutes and now I am looking forward to my first 10K... and being okay with sweating and being a little out of breath."</p>

            <p class="lead card-text text-shadow text-white w-100 d-none d-block">"10 weeks ago I was toying with the idea of running to get fit and lose weight, but I was hesitant as 'I'm not a runner'. I tentatively asked Wayne what work would theoretically be required to start running. He said he could help me to run for an hour within 8 weeks AND that I would be enjoying it and looking forward to my next run. I thought he was out of his mind and clearly didn't understand that 'I'm not a runner'. At our first meeting, Wayne used a mix of his extensive running expertise, his dead-pan humour, and his insane passion for running to explain his 8 week plan. He said the magic words that had me hooked - 'I don't care how fast you go, as long as you feel like you're running, then you're running'. With Wayne's guidance, 8 weeks later I ran for an hour without stopping. Seems like I am a runner after all. I would unhesitatingly recommend Wayne to any individual or group who needs running support - whether it's technical support, motivation, or confidence building."</p>

I benefitted tremendously from his guidance and timed runs, and approached race day with confidence."</p>

            <p class="lead card-text text-shadow text-white w-100 d-none d-lg-block">"16 weeks before the Berlin marathon 2017, (my first marathon,) I walked into Wayne’s office and said “I need help. I haven’t trained yet.” Wayne took me under his wing and got me started on a training plan and became my mentor. He not only advised on my training, technique, and answered any random question I had, but he also introduced me to many other runners who I ended up training with. Wayne himself joined me on almost all of my weekly long runs, ensuring hours of entertainment so I would forget the time. 16 weeks later, there I was in Berlin. I was injury-free and confident in my ability to make it through running. I enjoyed every step of the run, finishing in the time I had set for myself! It was one of the best experiences of my life, and Wayne was the person who helped me get there. He has so much knowledge and experience to share, and is a fantastic person. Thank you, Coach."</p>

He always told me I had the genetics for it, but I never found the passion for it until last year. I decided to sign up for a half marathon. I ran cross country and track in high school and middle school respectively, but I was a terrible runner! With my dad's personalized 16-week training program, I went from running middle distances at an 11-minute pace to being able to run 10 miles at a 9:30 pace. And I'm still getting faster! I was one of those people who couldn't understand why folks like my dad would wake up at 7am on a Sunday to run. But now I get it, because I'm one of those people. I completely fell in love with running with my dad's start small and doable coaching plan. Throughout training I never felt like I wouldn't be able to complete my half marathon. Finishing my race has been my biggest physical accomplishment to date. And my dad was right - my life is better now that running is a part of it."</p>
