            <p class="lead card-text text-white w-100 d-none d-block">"10 weeks ago I was toying with the idea of running to get fit and lose weight, but I was hesitant, as I'm not a runner.<br>I tentatively asked Wayne what work would theoretically be required to start running. He said he could help me to run for an hour within 8 weeks AND he told me I would be enjoying it and looking forward to my next run. I thought he was out of his mind and clearly didn't understand: I'm not a runner.<br>At our first meeting, Wayne used a mix of his extensive running expertise, his deadpan humour, and his insane passion for running to explain his 8-week plan. He said the magic words that had me hooked: “I don't care how fast you go--as long as you feel like you're running, then you're running.”<br>With Wayne's guidance, 8 weeks later I ran for an hour without stopping. Seems like I am a runner after all. I would unhesitatingly recommend Wayne to any individual or group that needs running support--whether it's technical support, motivation, or confidence building."</p>

            <p class="lead card-text text-white w-100 d-none d-lg-block">"16 weeks before my first marathon (the 2017 Berlin marathon), I walked into Wayne’s office and said, “I need help. I haven’t trained yet.”<br>Wayne took me under his wing, got me started on a training plan, and became my mentor. He not only advised on my training, technique, and any random questions I had, he also introduced me to many other runners that I ended up training with. Wayne himself joined me on almost all of my weekly long runs, ensuring hours of entertainment so I would forget the time.<br>16 weeks later, there I was in Berlin. I was injury-free and confident in my ability to make it through running. I enjoyed every step of the run, finishing in the time I had set for myself! It was one of the best experiences of my life, and Wayne was the person who helped me get there. He has so much knowledge and experience to share, and is a fantastic person. Thank you, Coach."</p>

It’s become very evident that those two things are related. (He did always tell me that running is good not just for your physical health, but your mental health, too!)<br>I ran track in middle school and cross country in high school, but I was a terrible runner! As an adult, I signed up for a half marathon on a whim, thinking, “I hope my dad has enough tricks up his coaching sleeve to help me finish!”<br>With my dad's personalized 16-week training program, I went from running middle distances at an 11-minute pace to being able to run 10 miles (without stopping!) at a 9:30 pace. And I'm still getting faster!<br>I was one of those people who couldn't understand why anyone would wake up at 7 am on a Sunday to run. But now I get it, because I'm one of those people. I completely fell in love with running because of my dad's “start small” and “doable” coaching plan. Throughout training I never felt like I wouldn't be able to complete my half marathon, or finish the mile in front of me. Completing my race has been my biggest physical accomplishment to date. Thanks, Dad!<br>I now know at least two more things: Coach Wayne knows best, and I love being a runner.”</p>

Somewhat of a miracle, actually. In celebration of his recovery, I wanted to run a marathon in his honor and to raise funds for those who suffer from heart disease.<br>I’ve never been a runner, nor had I ever envisioned running an actual full marathon. I knew I was way ahead of myself, but as a New York native, it had always been a dream of mine to run the NYC marathon. I emailed Coach Wayne and asked if he would meet me over a coffee for a chat. My life changed from that moment on.<br>Wayne took his time and helped me put together a plan that best suited my abilities. Wayne’s encouragement and enthusiasm were the greatest motivators. He helped me realize my potential not only as a runner, but as a human being. I had never pushed myself so hard and it was the most exhilarating, grueling, gratifying, life-altering experience of my entire life. It hurt so good! So good that I went on to run another three marathons and several halfs/10Ks in between.<br>With Wayne, I gained more than a running coach--he’s my forever friend."</p>

Everyone can run--it's just practice that makes you better."<br>I knew Coach Wayne as an undergraduate student at New York University Abu Dhabi. I could see myself improving (getting stronger, faster, and a better technique) week by week thanks to his workouts. As much as I enjoyed them, though, what really stuck with me was Coach Wayne's commitment to our weekly track workouts. Regardless of how many people would show up, he would be out on the track every Sunday at the given hour.<br>One time, I was late to arrive and was surprised to see no one on the track--no one except Coach Wayne, that is. Even though I was the only person there, he gave me a workout to do and stayed with me to watch my form and instruct my pace and sets. He is always very supportive of all his runners and has a good eye for observing running form.<br>I always felt at ease when Coach Wayne was around. He was supportive and welcoming, and he had an open door policy such that I could walk into his office and talk about anything with him. Besides being a great running coach from a technical standpoint, what makes Coach Wayne a truly beloved coach is the relationships he fosters with his runners.<br>I would also like to add that I think Coach Wayne has a great sense of humor.*"</p>
