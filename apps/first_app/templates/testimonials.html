They always seem to be able to run for miles without breaking a sweat or show any indication of being out of breath. Wayne introduced me to running in a way that was without judgment and empowering.  He taught me to gently build on what I was able to accomplish.  I started out barely able to run 7 minutes and now I am looking forward to my first 10K... and being okay with sweating and being a little out of breath."</p>

            <p class="lead card-text text-white w-100 d-none d-block">"10 weeks ago I was toying with the idea of running to get fit and lose weight, but I was hesitant as 'I'm not a runner'. I tentatively asked Wayne what work would theoretically be required to start running. He said he could help me to run for an hour within 8 weeks AND that I would be enjoying it and looking forward to my next run. I thought he was out of his mind and clearly didn't understand that 'I'm not a runner'. At our first meeting, Wayne used a mix of his extensive running expertise, his dead-pan humour, and his insane passion for running to explain his 8 week plan. He said the magic words that had me hooked - 'I don't care how fast you go, as long as you feel like you're running, then you're running'. With Wayne's guidance, 8 weeks later I ran for an hour without stopping. Seems like I am a runner after all. I would unhesitatingly recommend Wayne to any individual or group who needs running support - whether it's technical support, motivation, or confidence building."</p>

            <p class="lead card-text text-white w-100 d-none d-lg-block">"16 weeks before the Berlin marathon 2017, (my first marathon,) I walked into Wayne’s office and said “I need help. I haven’t trained yet.” Wayne took me under his wing and got me started on a training plan and became my mentor. He not only advised on my training, technique, and answered any random question I had, but he also introduced me to many other runners who I ended up training with. Wayne himself joined me on almost all of my weekly long runs, ensuring hours of entertainment so I would forget the time. 16 weeks later, there I was in Berlin. I was injury-free and confident in my ability to make it through running. I enjoyed every step of the run, finishing in the time I had set for myself! It was one of the best experiences of my life, and Wayne was the person who helped me get there. He has so much knowledge and experience to share, and is a fantastic person. Thank you, Coach."</p>

He always told me I had the genetics for it, but I never found the passion for it until 2016, when I decided to sign up for a half marathon on a whim. I ran cross country and track in high school and middle school respectively, but I was a terrible runner! With my dad's personalized 16-week training program, I went from running middle distances at an 11-minute pace to being able to run 10 miles (without stopping!) at a 9:30 pace. And I'm still getting faster! I was one of those people who couldn't understand why folks like my dad would wake up at 7am on a Sunday to run. But now I get it, because I'm one of those people. I completely fell in love with running with my dad's start small and doable coaching plan. Throughout training I never felt like I wouldn't be able to complete my half marathon, or finish the mile in front of me. Completing my race has been my biggest physical accomplishment to date. And my dad was right - my life is better now that running is a part of it."</p>

At the time my father had been severely ill and made an unexpected full recovery.  Somewhat of a miracle, actually. I decided in celebration of his recovery, I wanted to run a marathon in his honor and to raise funds for those who suffer from heart disease. I’ve never been a runner, nor had I ever envisioned running an actual full marathon. I knew I was way ahead of myself, but as a New York native, it had always been a dream of mine to run the NYC marathon. I emailed Coach Wayne and asked if he would meet me over a coffee for a chat. My life changed from that moment on. Wayne took his time and helped me put together a plan that best suited my abilities. Wayne’s encouragement and enthusiasm was the greatest motivator. He helped me realize my potential as not only a runner, but as a human being. I had never pushed myself so hard and it was the most exhilarating, grueling, gratifying, life-altering experience of my entire life. It hurt so good! So good that I went on to run another three marathons and several halfs/10k's in between. With Wayne, I gained more than a running coach, he’s my forever friend."</p>

                  <p class="lead card-text text-white w-100 d-none d-lg-block">"I was an undergraduate student at NYUAD from 2012-2016. I had run cross-country in high school, so I was not a beginner, but Coach Wayne was very welcoming to everyone, and highly encouraged everyone to run; he always said, "You don't have to be a runner to run. Everyone can run-- it's just practice that makes you better." There are many running opportunities at NYUAD that Coach Wayne advertised, and I was eager to jump on board many of them (ie. Wadih Bih, monthly road races, indoor triathlons, a half-marathon in Cyprus, and more). I, personally, really benefited from his weekly Sunday Track Workouts. It can be really difficult to motivate yourself to design and execute tough workouts by yourself, so I really looked forward to this intense weekly session that he organized. I liked that Coach Wayne was there to explain the workout, keep track of everything (splits, rest time, intervals, etc), yell at us to pick up the pace or to shout encouraging thoughts from across the track, and share with us countless running tips as we gasped for air in between sets. I enjoyed running hard with a group under his watch, and I could see myself improving (getting stronger, faster, and/or better technique) week by week thanks to his workouts. As much as I enjoyed them, what really stuck with me is Coach Wayne's commitment to these weekly track workouts. Regardless of how many people would show up, Coach Wayne would be out on the track every Sunday at the given hour. During exam time or particularly busy times during the school year sometimes there would only be one or two people who would come to his sessions. One time, I was running late and was surprised to see no one on the track-- no one except Coach Wayne that is. Even though I was the only person, he gave me a workout to do and stayed with me to watch my form and instruct my pace and sets. He was always very supportive of all his runners and had a good eye for observing running form. He would sometimes even videotape us and play the recording back in slow motion to show us exactly what we could fix. Another one of the things I will never forget about Coach Wayne is his love of the megaphone. Coach Wayne was a volunteer for just about every road race I raced in in Abu Dhabi, and he always had the "announcer" role, so I got to hear his encouraging voice narrate my run as I passed by, along with some additional words of motivation. To me, his megaphone volunteering at early morning races exemplified both his dedication to the sport of running as well as his commitment to building (being a big contributor) to his community, and it showcased his cheery personality. Besides being a great running coach from a technical standpoint, what makes Coach Wayne a truly beloved coach is the relationships he fosters with his runners. I always felt at ease when he was around, that he was supportive and welcoming, and that he had an open door policy such that I could just walk into his office and talk about anything with him. I would also like to add that I think Coach Wayne has a great sense of humor."</p>
